# iOS-App-Dev-Projects

## Summary for the projects

This project directory is made just for fun and to improve my programming level in iOS App Development. Some of the projects are my personal projects, some are sub-functionality programs which will be used inside main programs. The remaining projects are practice questions given as homework for the iOS-App-Dev course done on Udemy.
The deliverables for the projects are individual iOS applications. 
The projects use Swift, Obj-C and Flutter(some apps) and a variety of application-level dependency managers such as cocopods and carthage!
Trello, Zenhub and Jira(for a few projects) were used for Agile project management
Git Kraken was used as a Git GUI client for the projects

## Project Descriptions

### Autolayout Practice with Dicee-iOS-11 
**Description**: Learning to use Autoloayout for the projects to allow the projects to be runnable on all the iOS devices<br/>
**Languages used**: Swift

### Destini iOS 11
**Description**: Works like magic ball (I guess?). Works like a storyline with different outcomes<br/>

**Languages used**: Swift

### I AM POOR
**Description**: You bought the $1000 app, now you're poor (jk). Learning to design my own UI elements for the storyboard and learning to make the app-icons for the application as well as the app-store. Used heavy animations for the project<br/>
**Languages used**: Swift

### MUSIC PLAYER
**Description**: Learnt to use AVAudioKit for embedding Music player in an application. This is a sub-functionality app used for the main project during my internship<br/>
**Languages used**: Swift, Obj-C

### QUIZZLER
**Description**: Same functionality as the Destini-11 with multiple storylines and outcomes<br/>
**Languages used**: Swift

### SW-BLADE MASTER
**Description**: This is a sub-functionality program for the contract role at University of Melbourne. Learned to have the blade effect as used in Fruit Ninja<br/>
**Languages used**: Swift, Obj-C and Adobe AfterEffects for UI

### SPRITE BASED SWIPE LINES
**Description**: This is a sub-functionality program for the contract role at University of Melbourne. Learned to cut the sprites with effects as used in Fruit Ninja<br/>
**Languages used**: Swift, Obj-C

### XYLOPHONE
**Description**: Just playing with the SKAudio Kit for building a xylophone app in iOS<br/>
**Languages used**: Swift

### COREDATA PRACTICE
**Description**: This is a sub-functionality program for one of my internships. Used for storing the applications permanent data for offline use, in this case the stored audio clips. Also used firebase to store the clips on a server.<br/>
**Languages used**: Swift, Firebase

### HEALTH BAR AUTOLAYOUT
**Description**: This is a sub-functionality program for the contract role at University of Melbourne. Learned to have a health bar as used in Fruit Ninja. Used cocoapods for animations as well.<br/>
